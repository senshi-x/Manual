# The Civilian

When playing on the Iraqi insurgent, Hamas or Taliban faction, players can choose to play as the Civilian. This roleâ€™s primary focus is to gather intelligence on Coalition forces and to run interference for the insurgent Cell Leaders. This kit does not come equipped with any weapons but has a wide variety of equipment and tools. Civilians can use their cellphones to spot enemy troops for their team by placing a marker on the map.

Civilians are bound by particular **rules of engagement** \(ROE\), explained [below](the_civilian.md#roe). Coalition forces cannot fire against civilians that are outside the rules of engagement, risking heavy penalizations. Instead they must **arrest** them or wait untill they're a legit target.

In order for a player to arrest a civilian, it must use the restrainers or the Shotgun with a buckshot round. Civilians that decide to commit suicide are also counted as arrested.

If you shoot a civilian outside the ROE, you will face several penalties:

* After your next death you will respawn 120 seconds later, per civilian shot \(stacks up to 5 minutes additional delay\)
* You will not be able to request any kits for 10 minutes
* Your score is reduced to 0 and the kill will not be listed on the scoreboard
* Your team loses 10 intelligence points

In the other hand, shooting a civilian inside the ROE will cause:

* The civilian to have an additional 120 seconds in the respawn time
* Your team gains 10 intelligence points

Running over civilians in a vehicle or shooting those climbing on ropes will also result in a penalty if done outside of the ROE.

## Rules Of Engagement \(ROE\) {#roe}

A civilian is considered inside the ROE and therefore can be killed if any of these conditions are met:

* Spawned...
* Have picked up a kit with a weapon...
* Used a vehicle...
* Used an epipen...

...less than 2 minutes prior to the engagement. Or he must have an armed insurgent next to him, within 5m horizontally or 1.5m vertically.

## Becoming a civilian

For you to become a civilian you must first either spawn as a non-armed soldier or to simply drop your kit \(Press **T** and then **G**\). Secondly, as mentioned in the previous section, you must wait 2 minutes after you spawn or dropping your kit and stay away from other Insurgents who are outside the ROE.

## Civilian vehicles {#civilian-vehicles}

Non armed-vehicles, including ammo techies and "Fake Garys" \(term used for dump or semi-trailer trucks carrying explosives\), must not be destroyed by Coalition forces.

A vehicle is considered civilian and therefor cannot be destroyed if:

* Is empty
* Does not have a gun
* Was last use more than 1 minute ago
* Has no enemies nearby \(3 meters\)

Failing to comply to this ROE will result:

* Loss of 5 intel points for the team
* Loss of 50 points for the player
